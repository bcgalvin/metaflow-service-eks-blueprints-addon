# Metaflow Service AddOn for Amazon EKS Blueprints

This repository contains the source code for the Metaflow Service AddOn
for [Amazon EKS Blueprints](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/cdk-eks-blueprints/). This AddOn is
a [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) construct that makes it easy for customers to add Metaflow Service to their Amazon
EKS
clusters.

[Amazon EKS Blueprints](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/cdk-eks-blueprints/) is a framework that allows users to
create internal development platforms that abstracts away a lot of the complexities involved with deploying cloud
infrastructure. It also
provides a nice user experience for deploying kubernetes across teams
with [Argo CD](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/cdk-eks-blueprints/addons/argo-cd/)
