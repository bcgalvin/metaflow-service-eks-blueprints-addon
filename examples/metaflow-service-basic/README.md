# Argo Workflows EKS Blueprint Addon

### Installation

To get started with this EKS Blueprint addon, first make sure you have the dependencies listed below installed on your
machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [CDK cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/)
- [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

If you've never used CDK before, you'll also need to bootstrap your AWS account with the required infrastructure for it
to work its magic. You can read more about what resources get created when you first bootstrapping your AWS
account [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html).

Once you're account is setup to work with CDK, the last step is to install the project dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm i
```

The Final step is to set the `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` and `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variables that the stack will
use to deploy to the right environment.

### Usage

You can deploy the infrastructure in the example stack with the following command (takes ~25 minutes to complete):

```bash
cdk deploy --require-approval=never --all
```

After everything is deployed successfully, you'll be able to access the EKS cluster from the `kubectl` commands that are
provided in the stack output:

```
